/*! \brief Default Settings for the MIDI Library.

 To change the default settings, don't edit them there, create a subclass and
 override the values in that subclass, then use the MIDI_CREATE_CUSTOM_INSTANCE
 macro to create your instance. The settings you don't override will keep their
 default value. Eg:
 \code{.cpp}
 struct MySettings : public midi::DefaultSettings
 {
    static const bool UseRunningStatus = false; // Messes with my old equipment!
 };

 MIDI_CREATE_CUSTOM_INSTANCE(HardwareSerial, Serial2, midi, MySettings);
 \endcode

     of the same type and channel.\n

     */

    /* NoteOn with 0 velocity should be handled as NoteOf.\n
     Set to 1 to get NoteOff events when receiving null-velocity NoteOn messages.\n
     Set to 0 to get NoteOn  events when receiving null-velocity NoteOn messages.
     */

    // call when data is available. This can speed up your application if receiving
    // a lot of traffic, but might induce MIDI Thru and treatment latency.

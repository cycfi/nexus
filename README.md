# Nexus
The Nexus is a small, flexible, and hacker friendly breakout box that connects your multichannel guitar to the outside world using a specialized (LEMO compatible) multi-pin connector for up to 15 channels of audio and 7 channels of analog control voltages for by-wire (remote) control of volume, tone, patch or effects. Audio may come from standard mono-pickups or from the Nu multichannel pickup. Analog control voltages are converted to MIDI control messages.
